To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/9.3.0/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon in the Gradle documentation.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build

Waiting for lock to be released...
Have been waiting on "Lock for cache='/home/timon/.gradle/caches/fabric-loom', project=':'" held by pid '1359111' for 1 minute(s).
If this persists for an unreasonable length of time, kill this process, run './gradlew --stop' and then try again.
